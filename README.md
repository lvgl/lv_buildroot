# LVGL Buildroot setup

This repository provides a foundational configuration for building a custom LVGL application on a target system generated using Buildroot.

The configuration is optimized for testing on the Raspberry Pi 4 (64-bit). However, the repository can be easily adapted to work with any Buildroot configuration or custom setup.

For detailed instructions and further information, refer to the [LVGL Buildroot guide](https://docs.lvgl.io/master/details/integration/os/buildroot/index.html).
